# Corona-Warn-App: Landing page

## About this Repository

This repository contains the source files of the official Corona-Warn-App landing page as it is available at [e.coronawarn.app](https://e.coronawarn.app) (for event-registration),[s.coronawarn.app](https://s.coronawarn.app) (for rapid antigen tests) & [p.coronawarn.app](https://p.coronawarn.app) (for rapid PCR tests). The page opens for first-time users who have not installed the CWA app after scanning a check-in QR code or a QR code for a rapid antigen/PCR test result with a native camera app. The page also opens for users who clicked a link on an external website and the browser does not redirect to the CWA. This might be due to preference settings of the browser app and/or OS settings.
For information about the project, please see our [documentation repository](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation).

## Development

### Requirements

You need the LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm) to build the website. Optionally, you need an HTTP Server such as [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) to run and test the deployment of the website locally.

### Getting started

Clone the repository and ensure to have all requirements installed. To build the website, switch to the `cwa-event-landingpage` base directory and execute the commands

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

After a successful build, you'll have a new folder `public` in the repository's base directory. It contains the generated files for the complete website.

To test the generated content, simply execute the command

```bash
npm start
```

It will automatically use `public` as base directory and watch for file changes. Go to `localhost:8000` to view the website.

### Updating the landing page

Pull Requests can be opened here on GitHub and will be merged into the `main` branch. Deployment of changes to [e.coronawarn.app](https://e.coronawarn.app) (for event-registration), [p.coronawarn.app](https://p.coronawarn.app) and [s.coronawarn.app](https://s.coronawarn.app) is done manually.
Thus, even if a PR is merged into `main` here on GitHub, changes are not immediately visible on the pages, but only after the changes have been deployed.

## Documentation

The full documentation for the Corona-Warn-App can be found in the [cwa-documentation](https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-documentation) repository. The documentation repository contains technical documents, architecture information, and white papers related to this implementation.

## How to contribute

The German government has asked SAP and Deutsche Telekom AG to develop the Corona-Warn-App for Germany as open source software. Deutsche Telekom is providing the network and mobile technology and will operate and run the backend for the app in a safe, scalable and stable manner. SAP is responsible for the app development, its framework and the underlying platform. Therefore, development teams of SAP and Deutsche Telekom are contributing to this project. At the same time our commitment to open source means that we are enabling -in fact encouraging- all interested parties to contribute and become part of its developer community.

For more information about how to contribute, the project structure, as well as additional contribution information, see our [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) at all times.
